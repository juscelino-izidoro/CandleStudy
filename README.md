CandleStudy is a project to help you to study financial market focusing on stock exchange graphical analysis.

As a programmer, this a project helps to study more about R, graphical interface and a lot of calculations for financial market.

The options for models are made fixed. As passing time I will try to make some configuration window, so you can set any other value to configure the selected model.

Be free to modify this project as your need.

Have a good study!

- How to make graphical interface on R by using GTK;
- How access market exchange information;
